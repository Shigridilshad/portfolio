                            <p> Education has always been a cornerstone of my life, shaping my identity and opening
                                doors to new opportunities. Before my accident in 2017, I was a proud student at Uswa
                                Public School Skardu, known for my academic performance and love for learning. As one of
                                the top students in my class, I embraced every challenge with enthusiasm, eager to
                                explore new subjects and expand my knowledge.
                                <hr>

                                However, everything changed after the accident that left me with spinal cord damage. My
                                life took an unexpected turn, and I found myself in a very different reality. The
                                physical and emotional toll of the injury forced me to pause my education for four long
                                years. Those years were some of the most difficult of my life. As I adjusted to life in
                                a wheelchair, I was also isolated from the academic world that had been such a big part
                                of my identity.

                            <h4> Solace in Books</h4>

                            Despite being away from formal education, my thirst for knowledge never waned. During those
                            years of recovery, when I spent much of my time alone in a room, books became my closest
                            companions. They provided an escape from the limitations of my physical condition and
                            allowed me to travel to new worlds, learn new concepts, and keep my mind active.
                            <hr>
                            I read voraciously, diving into topics ranging from technology and science to literature and
                            philosophy. This self-directed learning became my lifeline, keeping my intellectual
                            curiosity alive and fueling my determination to one day return to formal education.

                            <h4>A New Beginning in Karachi</h4>

                            After four years of recovery, I knew it was time to take control of my future. I left my
                            village and moved to Karachi, a bustling city that offered new opportunities and resources
                            for my personal and academic growth. It was a bold decision, but one that was necessary for
                            me to reclaim my life and pursue my dreams.
                            <hr>
                            In Karachi, I enrolled at Allama Iqbal Open University, restarting my formal education. This
                            was a significant milestone for me—a fresh start after years of uncertainty and struggle.
                            The flexibility of distance learning allowed me to study at my own pace, balancing my
                            physical limitations with my academic ambitions. It was a new challenge, but one that I
                            embraced with the same determination that had carried me through my years of recovery.

                            <h4>The Road Ahead</h4>

                            Today, as I continue my studies and build my career in web development and digital
                            marketing, I look back on my educational journey with immense pride. While the path has been
                            far from easy, every setback has only strengthened my resolve. My time away from formal
                            education taught me the value of self-discipline, patience, and the importance of never
                            giving up on your dreams.
                            <hr>
                            Education, in all its forms—whether through books or university courses—has been the driving
                            force behind my personal and professional growth. And though I missed several years of
                            formal schooling, those years were not wasted. They were a period of self-discovery and
                            resilience, preparing me for the road ahead.
